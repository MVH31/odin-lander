Hey everyone! 👋🏻
It is an assignment I took myself from The Odin Projects ⚡ website.

v1: Creation of repository and cloning it into my local machine.

v1.1: Creation of HTML and CSS. Left images part to add them later.

v1.2: Added photos for better visuals.

Thus it marks the end of my landing page project.
